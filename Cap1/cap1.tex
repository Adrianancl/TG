	In many machining cases, orthogonal cutting may be considered a good approximation to perform on the major cutting edge, that is why it has been extensively studied \cite {shaw2005metal}. For instance, planing and facing processes are some examples that orthogonal cutting conditions can be observed.

	Also, it is knonw that thermal behavior during the cutting process, as temperature fields and heat flows, has a important influence on tool life, surface finish and mattalurgical structure of workpiece and machinability. Then, the study of thermal analysis on orthogonal cutting case shall be able to provide a better comprehension of many studies concerning thermal modeling of metal cuting processes \cite {komanduri2000thermal}, \cite{komanduri2001thermal}.
	
	\section{Mechanics of orthogonal cutting}

	In this paper it will be show numerous correlations among forces, stresses and dimensions for example. For this purpose it is important to discuss about geometrical correlations in the composite cutting force circle (figure \ref{fig:circlec}).

	\begin{figure}[h]

		\captionsetup{justification=centering}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Cap1/circlec.png}
		\caption{Cutting forces \cite{shaw2005metal}}
		\label{fig:circlec}
	\end{figure}

	From the figure \ref{fig:circlec} it can be stated about forces on the primary shear zone reference $F_{S}$ and $N_{S}$:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	F_{S} = F_{P}\cos\phi - F_{Q}\sin\phi
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	N_{S} = F_{Q}\cos\phi + F_{P}\sin\phi
	\end{equation}

	Also for the forces on the chip flow reference:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	F_{C} = F_{P}\sin\alpha + F_{Q}\cos\alpha
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	N_{C} = F_{P}\cos\alpha - F_{Q}\sin\alpha
	\end{equation}

	These equation provide all auxiliar forces related to the known passive force $F_{Q}$ and force on the cutting direction $F_{P}$. Now, the variables of interest can be easily calculated, as the friction coefficient:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{eq_friction}
	\mu = \frac{F_{C}}{N_{C}} = \frac{F_{Q} + F_{P}\tan\alpha}{F_{P} - F_{Q}\tan\alpha}
	\end{equation}

	Now the equations concerning about stresses are:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	A_{S} = \frac{wa_{p}}{\sin\phi}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	\tau = \frac{F_{S}}{A_{S}} = \frac{(F_{P}\cos\phi - F_{Q}\sin\phi)\sin\phi}{wa_{p}}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	\sigma = \frac{N_{S}}{A_{S}} = \frac{(F_{P}\sin\phi + F_{Q}\cos\phi)\sin\phi}{wa_{p}}
	\end{equation}

	Where $A_{S}$ is the area of the shear plane, $\tau$ is the shear stress and $\sigma$ is the normal stress.

	Another important parameter is the cutting ratio $r$, which can provide an important relation between the main cutting velocity and the chip outlet velocity. It is found experimentally that there is no change in density of metal during the cutting process and also for $w/a_{p} \geq 5$ the width of the chip is the same of the workpiece. Then, the equations are:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	a_{p}wl = a_{pc}w_{c}l_{c}
	\end{equation}

	Where $a_{p}$, w and l are the depth of cut, width of cut and length of cut respectively. Then, the cutting ratio is defined by:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	r = \frac{a_{p}}{a_{pc}} = \frac{l_{c}}{l}
	\end{equation}

	Having the cutting ratio, it is now possible to correlate cutting velocity $v$ and chip outlet velocity $v_{c}$ by means of the following equation:

	\begin{equation} 
	\label{}
	v_{c} = rv
	\end{equation}
