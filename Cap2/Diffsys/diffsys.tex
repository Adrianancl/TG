	Another proprietary software being used at Fraunhofer IPT, Diffsys is a program for simulation of machining operations. It has the flexibility to import and handle multiple types of point clouds and movement patterns, such as spirals, helices, concentric circles, from files with many different formats and extensions.
	
	One main feature of Diffsys is that it provides a visualization of the turning routine, plotting the points and the tool path, showing the tool and animating the process. It can even plot a visual representation of the velocity and acceleration vectors in real time during the animation, thus giving the user the possibility to predict the dynamic behavior of the process and allowing for the refinement of turning parameters in order to increase productivity without compromising surface quality. It also has a radius compensation algorithm, making it a complete solution for treating point clouds for machining.
	
	However, it is not able to handle geometry files, such as IGES. Therefore, it requires a previous stage which can extract a point cloud from the geometry itself.
