	I would like to thank my family for everything they have done and still do for me, with endless love and comprehension. They are the main reason of this accomplishment, telling me always the importance of education in my life, which comes to be the best present they could give to me. My parents Ivanildo and Concei\c{c}{\~a}o, who demonstrated huge commitment with hard work, intending to provide better schools for me and my siblings. I also especially thank my siblings Aline and Alisson, who were my great examples of perseverance and the first ones to encourage me to pursue my dream to become an engineer from ITA.

	I thank my roommates over my time at H8, J\'essica, Giuliana, Sarah, Eduarda, Dafne, Camilla, Ana Paula and Catarina. They helped me to grow up and relieve my longing for home.

	I thank Thorsten Augspurguer, who provided me guidance during my internship in Germany, which was a great professional and personal experience. I also thank my coworkers at the time and friends Florisa and Renata for their support and for having made my days even better.

	Finally, I thank Abra{\~a}o for the motivation you provided me. Every opportunity you made me see, the strength you gave me when I needed most and your support to my professional aims were essential to make my path a lot easier. Thank you for being part of my life.
