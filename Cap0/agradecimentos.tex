	I thank my family for all the support to my personal and academic growth. My father Pedro, my great example of righteousness and perseverance, who made me admire ITA through his life story. My mother Leila, who never hesitated to provide me with the best possible preparation in all aspects of life. My little sister Nat{\'a}lia, my first experience as a tutor, who fascinates me today by teaching me so much. Wilza, who raised me as a second mother, with endless love and affect. Thank you for sharing with me so intensely this life changing experience.

	I thank the ITA Baja team and members, who became a family to me amidst all endless days and nights spent together at the workshop, often fighting through exhaustion and stress, all focused in a common goal: building the best possible Baja. I thank you for all technical knowledge and experience, besides the resilience and togetherness I acquired during my time with you.
	
	I thank the people who have crossed ways with me in my still short professional path: Ronnie, Borille, Rafael, Diogo, Daniel and Ceyhun. Thank you for offering me guidance and support as I try to grow and improve.
	
	Finally, I thank Nathianne, who has been with me since almost the beginning of my journey in ITA, providing me with motivation and emotional support when the burden got heavier. If not for you, the path would have certainly been a lot rougher. Thank you for sticking with me.
