	Methods for inspection and monitoring have been used each time more to guarantee the quality of processes. In the machining field there are many important parameters to assure that a process arranges the designed results. The superficial finishing of a workpiece and the tool life are some examples subjected to the direct influence of thermal energy generated in the heat zones. Due to it, there are a lot of theoretical methods for temperature modeling along the cutting zone, but still there is a lack of ways able to allow practical validation of these methods. Although many challenges still prevail on the suitable use of thermography, this technology makes possible the development of computational methods for processing of thermal images and, consequently, the heat flow and heat partition analysis.
	This paper comes to present a computational method developed on MATLAB with image processing toolbox support. It makes thermal image analysis, providing results about temperature fields, inner energies, heat flows and other variables of interest that can be used on machining monitoring and future studies to improve cutting parameters.
