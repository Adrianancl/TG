	% The handling of geometry files is usually associated with the usage of CAD software, which commonly have costly licenses due to the amount of sophisticated features that they offer. This expense is easily justifiable when the work involves thorough application of a number of these functions, for example, when developing a new geometry for a given project. However, for many users, the task is simple and only requires a small amount of features, for example, when generating a regular pattern of projections along a surface to obtain a set of points to guide the path of a turning or milling tool throughout a machining process. These clients usually have to spend a lot of money on licenses, only to use a small portion of what the program has to offer.
	% This paper presents a solution which can directly read an IGES geometry file and generate a specific set of points using simple open source functions. Although it is programmed using $MATLAB^{TM}$, it is compiled to an independent executable file, thus being capable of running without any license at all.
