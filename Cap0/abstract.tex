	Methods for inspection and monitoring have been used more and more to ensure the quality of processes. In the machining field there are many important process parameters to assure that the expected results are achieved. The surface quality of a workpiece and the tool life, for example, are directly influenced by the thermal energy generated in the heat zones. Due to it, there are lots of theoretical methods for temperature modeling along the cutting zone, but there is still a lack of tools able to allow for practical validation of these methods. Although many challenges still prevail for the adequate use of thermography, this technology enables the development of computational methods for processing of thermal images and, consequently, the heat flow and heat partition analysis.
	This paper comes to present a computational method developed on MATLAB with the support of image processing toolbox. It performs thermal image analysis, providing results regarding temperature fields, inner energies, heat flows and other variables of interest that can be used on machining monitoring and future studies to improve cutting parameters.
