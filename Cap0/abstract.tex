	Methods for inspection and monitoring have been used each time more to guarantee the quality of processes. In the machining field there are many important parameters to assure that a process provide the designed results. The superficial finishing of a workpiece and the life of tool are some examples subjected to the direct influence of thermal energy generated in the cutting zones. Due to it, there are a lot of theoretical methods for temperature modeling along the cutting zone, but still there is a lack of tools able to allow a practical validation of these methods. Although many challenges still prevail on the suitable use of thermography, this technology makes possible the development of computational methods that allows the thermal image processing and, consequently, the heat flow and heat partition analysis afterwards.
	This paper comes to present a computational method developed on MATLAB, with image processing toolbox support. It makes thermal image analysis, providing results about temperature fields, inner energies, heat flows and other variables of interest that can be used on machining monitoring and studies to improve cutting parameters.
